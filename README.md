# NodeCaller Project Documentation üìû

---

## Overview
**NodeCaller** appears to be a web-based application focused on **real-time communication**, likely a **calling or communication platform**. Developed by devbyaryanvala, it leverages Node.js for backend functionalities and standard web technologies for the frontend to enable interactive user experiences.

---

## Technologies Used
The project is primarily built with:

* **Backend**: üü¢ **JavaScript** (92.0%) running on **Node.js**. This indicates that the server-side logic and potentially real-time communication (e.g., using WebSockets or WebRTC signaling) are handled by a Node.js server.
* **Frontend**: üìÑ **HTML** (8.0%) and **JavaScript** (client-side part of the 92%). HTML is used for structuring the user interface, while client-side JavaScript handles interactivity, user events, and communication with the backend.

---

## Features (Inferred)
Based on the project name "NodeCaller" and the typical structure of similar web applications by the same author, the likely core features include:
* **Real-time Communication**: Enables users to connect and interact in real-time, potentially for voice or video calls.
* **Web-based Interface**: Accessible through a web browser, requiring no specific software installation on the client side.

---

## Project Structure (Based on observed files)
The repository contains common files for a web application with a Node.js backend:
* `index.html`: The main HTML file for the client-side user interface.
* `app.js`: Likely contains client-side JavaScript logic or main application setup.
* `server.js`: The primary server-side script responsible for setting up the Node.js server and handling requests/connections.

## Setup and Local Execution (General Guidance)

**Please Note**: Specific, detailed instructions for setting up and running *this particular* NodeCaller project locally are currently not available in the repository or through external searches. The following are general steps commonly required for Node.js web applications, especially those involving real-time communication. You may need to examine the project's source code for precise configurations, dependencies, and specific startup commands.

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    Begin by cloning the project from its GitHub repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/devbyaryanvala/nodecaller.git](https://github.com/devbyaryanvala/nodecaller.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    Change your current working directory to the newly cloned project folder.
    ```bash
    cd nodecaller
    ```

3.  **Install Node.js Dependencies**:
    If the project uses any Node.js packages, they would typically be listed in a `package.json` file. You'll need to install them.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *(If a `package.json` file is present in the root, this command will install all required packages. If not, the project might rely only on native Node.js modules.)*

4.  **Run the Server**:
    The presence of `server.js` suggests that you can start the application by running this file with Node.js.
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    *(Alternatively, check for a `start` script in `package.json` if available, e.g., `npm start`.)*

5.  **Access the Application**:
    Once the server is running, you can usually access the frontend by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:[PORT]`. The specific port (e.g., 3000, 8080, 5000) will be defined within the `server.js` file or `app.js`.

For a comprehensive understanding and to discover specific implementation details (such as signaling mechanisms or WebRTC configurations), it is highly recommended to explore the source code directly within the [NodeCaller GitHub repository](https://github.com/devbyaryanvala/nodecaller) üßë‚Äçüíª.
